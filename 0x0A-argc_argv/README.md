Why did they have to call parameters arguments when starting out?

	- Why are they even called arguments
	- What are we arguing about?
	- Just call them parameters to leave out any ambiguity.

	-The term was adopted by computer scientists when they applied mathematical reasoning to programming in the mid 20th century.

	-The word argument has the general sense of something from which another thing may be deduced. It comes ‘from the L. arguere “make clear, make known, prove, declare, demonstrate,” from PIE *argu-yo-, from root *arg- “to shine, be white, bright, clear” ’, which root is also preserved in the words argent (“silvery white”) and Argentina (“[river] of silver”).¹

	-Its use in English to mean a “mathematical quantity from which another … quantity may be deduced, or on which its calculation depends” is attested as early as 1386:

     	-Argument (ā·ɹgiuměnt). [a. F. argument (13th c.), ad. L. argūment-um, f. arguěre (or refashioning, after this, of OF. arguement, f. arguer): see ARGUE. For use of the L. form, see 3 c.]
     2. Astr. and Math. The angle, arc, or other mathematical quantity, from which another required quantity may deduced, or on which its calculation depends.
